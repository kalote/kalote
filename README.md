### Hi there 👋

My name's Johann BICH, I've been working in tech for the past 20 years (gosh I'm old -_-') as a:
- Web dev (flash, action script, jquery, php, Zend framework ... ahhh, the good ole days)
- Lead dev (same tech + jira & confluence)
- Business analyst (I wanted to know more about the process to transform "functional requirements" into "technical reality")
- UX UI designer ("Don't make me think" => best book about it)
- DevOps (Jenkins, K8s, AWS, sonarQube, groovy, python, nodeJS, React)
- Lead devOps (same tech + openshift, istio + jira & confluence)
- Engineer manager (powerpoint, excel, ... (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻)
- GM Engineering team (same but with more excel ... (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻)
- Tech lead (nodeJS, React, Solidity, Tailwindcss, NestJS, NextJS, Golang)
